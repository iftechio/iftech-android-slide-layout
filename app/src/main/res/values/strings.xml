        This interface should be implemented by View subclasses that wish to support dispatching nested scrolling operations to a cooperating parent ViewGroup.\n
        Classes implementing this interface should create a final instance of a NestedScrollingChildHelper as a field and delegate any View methods to the NestedScrollingChildHelper methods of the same signature.
        Views invoking nested scrolling functionality should always do so from the relevant ViewCompat, ViewGroupCompat or ViewParentCompat compatibility shim static methods. This ensures interoperability with nested scrolling views on Android 5.0 Lollipop and newer.
        Dispatch a fling to a nested scrolling parent.
        This method should be used to indicate that a nested scrolling child has detected suitable conditions for a fling. Generally this means that a touch scroll has ended with a velocity in the direction of scrolling that meets or exceeds the minimum fling velocity along a scrollable axis.
        If a nested scrolling child view would normally fling but it is at the edge of its own content, it can use this method to delegate the fling to its nested scrolling parent instead. The parent may optionally consume the fling or observe a child fling.
